Created my own TTS XD

This project is a simple text-to-speech converter that uses recorded phonic sounds to generate speech based on user input.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-speech.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd text-to-speech

3. Install the required Python dependencies


4. Download and set up FFmpeg:

- FFmpeg is required for audio format conversions. It allows this project to convert WAV files to MP3 format.

- For Windows 7 or above, follow these steps:

## Usage

1. Place your recorded phonic sounds in the `voice_folder` directory.

2. Run the script:

3. Enter the sentence you want to convert to speech when prompted.

4. The script will convert the sentence to speech using the corresponding phonic sounds and play the generated audio.
